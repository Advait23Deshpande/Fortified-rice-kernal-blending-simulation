# Fortified-rice-kernal-blending-simulation

This repository contains a Python program for simulating the blending of fortified rice kernels with regular rice kernels in a 1:100 ratio. The program takes into account the properties of the two types of rice kernels, including their densities and sizes, and uses a mixing speed optimization algorithm to achieve the desired blending ratio with high accuracy. 
With this simulation model, users can input the properties of the fortified rice kernels and the desired batch size in tonnes, and the program will output the optimal mixing speed and blending time needed to achieve the 1:100 blending ratio as per standard stipulated by FSSAI. 
This can help food manufacturers optimize their production process for fortified rice, ensuring that the desired nutritional content is achieved consistently and efficiently. Please note that the specific process parameters and formulations for the fortified rice and regular rice kernels may affect the accuracy of the simulation. It's important to validate any simulation results with experimental data and adjust the simulation parameters as needed to achieve the desired blending ratio.
The program is open-source and can be easily customized to suit specific production requirements. It can also be used as a basis for further research into rice blending and other food processing applications. I hope that this simulation model will be a valuable tool for food scientists and engineers in the pursuit of improved food products and production processes.
